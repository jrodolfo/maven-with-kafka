# Kafka Maven Application

The majority of the code of this app was taken from this course:
                                                    
    Apache Kafka Series - Learn Apache Kafka for Beginners v2, by Stephane Maarek
    https://www.udemy.com/course/apache-kafka/

The course is great - I highly recommend it.

See the instructions from doc/kafka-on-windows.txt to learn 
how to install Kafka on Windows and make it work, so that you
will be able to test this app.
